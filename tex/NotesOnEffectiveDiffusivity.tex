\section{The Advection-Diffusion Equation}

\subsection{Preliminaries}
We are concerned with the lateral advection and diffusion of a  passive scalar (tracer). The evolution
of the tracer concentration $\vth$ is governed by
\beq
\label{ad}
\vth_t  + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla \vth =  \So + \kappa \lap \vth\com
\eeq
where $\So$ represents sources, $\kappa$ is the molecular diffusivity of the tracer $\vth$, and the horizontal laplacian
is $\lap \defn \p_x^2 + \p_y^2$. The advection-diffusion equation above is also often written as 
and \eqref{ad} can be re-written 
\beq
\label{adsf}
\vth_t  + \sJ(\psi,\vth) \vth =  \So + \kappa \lap \vth\com
\eeq
where the horizontal Jacobian is $\sJ(A,B) = A_x B_y - B_x A_y$, and the streamfunction $\psi$, associated with the non-divergent flow $\vec{u}$, is defined by
\beq
\label{sf}
u = -\psi_y\com \qquad \text{and} \qquad v = \psi_x\per
\eeq

\subsection{Zonnaly-averaged Equations}
For application in simple periodic domain, it is convenient to introduce zonally-averaged equations. In more complicated geometries, similar decompositions can be achieved given a well-defined average, which in practice is a combination of time and space averaging. Introducing the Reynolds decomposition
\begin{align}
\label{rey}
\vth(x,y,t) = \la\vth\ra_x(y,t)+ \vth'(x,y,t)\com\nonumber \\
\psi(x,y,t) = \la\psi\ra_x(y,t) + \psi'(x,y,t)\com \\
\end{align}
where
\beq
\la f \ra_x(y,t) = \frac{1}{L_x}\int_0^{L_x}\!\!\! f(x,y,t) \, \dd x\per
\eeq
With periodicity in $x$, the $x-$averaged $y-$velocity vanishes $\bar{v} = \bar{\psi}_x = 0$. 
The $x-$averaged tracer equation is then
\beq
\label{xave_ad}
\p_t \la\vth\ra_x + \p_y \la v' \vth'\ra_x = \la S \ra_x + \kappa \p_y^2 \la\vth\ra_x\per
\eeq
For completeness, the equation for the perturbation about the $x-$averaged tracer is
\beq
\label{pad}
\vth'_t + \p_x(u' \vth') + \p_y(v' \vth') + \p_x (u'\la\vth\ra_x) + \p_y(v' \la\vth\ra_x) - \p_y \la v'\vth'\ra_x = S' + \kappa (\p_y^2 \vth' + \p_x^2\vth)\per
\eeq

\subsection{Eddy diffusion}
This notes discusses different methods for estimating ocean eddy diffusivities. A common heuristic argument is parameterize eddy transport such as $\overline{v'\vth'}$ with a down-gradient
 eddy-difussivity
\beq
\label{eddy_visc}
\overline{v'\vth'} = -\kappae \p_y \bvth\per
\eeq
The introduction of the eddy diffusivity \eqref{eddy_visc} needs to be justified more formally. For now, it suffices to mention that  \eqref{eddy_visc} is a good approximation provided there is enough scale separation between the large-scale tracer gradient the eddy scales. Thus the parameterization \eqref{eddy_visc}  is used to close the zonally-averaged equation \eqref{xave_ad}:
\beq
\label{xave_ad_2}
\bvth_t   = \bar{S} + \kappat \p_y^2 \bvth\com
\eeq
where the total diffusivity is $\kappat \defn \kappae + \kappa$. There is significant inconsistency in the literature regarding 
notation and naming of diffusivities.  The term ``effective diffusivity''  is used to refer to $\kappat$ by some authors. Other investigators refer to $\kappae$ as the ``effective diffusivity'' likely recognizing that for large Peclet number $\kappat \approx \kappae$. The term ``eddy diffusivity'' is equally used to refer to both $\kappat$ or $\kappae$.

\subsection{Integral variance budget}
With harmless boundary conditions (e.g., double periodicity or no-flux across the boundaries) the tracer variance
equation is
\beq
\label{varvth}
\frac{\dd}{\dd t}  \int \half \vth^2 \dd A = \int \vth \So \dd A - \kappa \int | \nabla \vth |^2 \dd A\per
\eeq
       

%We can also write equations for the tracer variance $\bvth^2$
%\beq
%\label{varbvth}
%\frac{\dd}{\dd t}  \int \half \bvth^2 \dd y = \int \overline{v'\vth'} \bvth_y \dd y + \int \bvth \bar{\So} \dd y - \kappa\!\! \int (\p_y \bvth)^2 \dd y\com
%\eeq
%and the tracer variance $\bar{\vth'}^2$
%\beq
%\label{varpvth}
%\frac{\dd}{\dd t}  \int \half \vth'^2 \dd A =  -\int \overline{v'\vth'} \bvth_y \dd y   + \int \vth' \So' \dd A - \kappa \int \left[ |\nabla \vth' |^2 + \p_x \vth' \p_x \bvth \right] \dd A \per
%\eeq


\section{Renovated Waves on a Lattice}

To begin exploring the accuracy of different methods to estimate ocean eddy diffusivities,
we use a simple advection-diffusion model on a lattice first proposed by Pierrehumbert (2000).
The idea is to break the advection and difussion in different steps. The advection step is further
separated in two sub-steps: advection in the x-direction and y-direction. The advection sub-steps are
performed on a lattice. That is, the advection in the x-direction corresponds to a shift in the 
x-direction, and the advection in the y-direction corresponds to a shift in the y-direction:
\beq
i_x^{n+1} = i_x^{n} - \text{int}\left[u(y) \tau/2 \right]\com
\eeq
and
\beq
i_y^{n+1} = i_y^{n} - \text{int}\left[v(x) \tau/2 \right]\com
\eeq
where the superscripts represent the iteration and $\tau$ is the length of the renovation cycle, typically a eddy-turnover timescale. Figure \ref{latticei} illustrates the advection sub-steps in a couple of renovation cycles.
Clearly, a very complex tracer pattern emerges after a couple of renovation cycles. Notice that this advection scheme exactly conserves the probability density of the tracer if no diffusion is applied (the lattice is just re-combined).

In a slight generalization of Pierrehumbert's model, we represent the non-divergent velocity field as linear combination of a spectrum of waves with random phase:
\beq
\label{un}
u(y) = C \sum_{j=j_{min}}^{j_{max}} \left(\frac{j}{j_{min}}\right)^{-p/2}\!\!\! \cos\left(\frac{2\pi y}{L_y} j + \phi_n\right)\com
\eeq
\beq
\label{vn}
v(x) = C \sum_{j=j_{min}}^{j_{max}} \left(\frac{j}{j_{min}}\right)^{-p/2}\!\!\! \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L_x} j + \psi_n\right)\com
\eeq
where $L_x$ and $L_y$ are the dimensions of the periodic domain, $\psi_n$ and $\phi_n$ are random phases drawn from a uniform distribution on $[0, 2\pi]$. Because these random phases are changed every iteration, this simple velocity field is termed renovated wave model. Note that in this generalized renovated wave model the kinetic energy spectrum of the flow follows a $j^{-p}$ power-law. Also in \eqref{un} and \eqref{vn}, $C$ is a normalization constant, determined so that the root-mean square velocity is prescribed 
\beq
C = u_{rms}\left(\sum_{j=j_{min}}^{j_{max}} \left(\frac{j}{j_{min}}\right)^{-p}\right)^{-1/2}\per
\eeq

       \caption{\small The advection on the two-dimensional periodic lattice. Notice that a complex pattern starts to emerge
    		after a couple of renovation cycles. With a bigger lattice, one no longer sees the pixel fragmentation,
		and the differential advection results in strong filamentation.}
		    \label{latticei}
\end{figure}

Pierrehumbert performs the diffusion step in physical space, as a simple average of neighboring points, corresponding
to a second-order finite-difference approximation for the laplacian operator. Here we take advantage of the periodicity
of this model, and perform the diffusion step more accurately in Fourier space:
\beq
\label{diff}
\hat{\vth}^{n+1/2}_{k,l} = \hat{\vth}^{n}_{k,l} \ee^{-\kappa(k^2+l^2)\tau/2}\per
\eeq

\subsection{Advection-diffusion with constant background tracer gradient}
Instead of using a large-scale source, we implement a constant background gradient $G$,
so that the tracer concentration equation is
\beq
\vth_t  + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla \vth + G v =  \kappa \lap \vth\per
\eeq

The $x-$averaged variance budget is
\beq
\label{xave_budget_Gy}
\p_ t \la \half \vth \raxt +  \p_y \la \half v \vth^2 \raxt + G \la v \vth \raxt  = \p_y^2 \la \half \vth^2 \raxt -\kappa \la  |\nabla \vth|^2\raxt \per
\eeq
Because the background gradient is constant, the system is statistically homogeneous in $y$. Thus, in statistical steady state,
the $x-$averaged variance budget \eqref{xave_budget_Gy} is exactly given by a balance between variance production and dissipation:
\beq
G \la v \vth \raxt  = -\kappa \la  |\nabla \vth|^2\raxt \per
\eeq

\subsubsection{The Osborn-Cox method}
 
Cox and Osborn introduced an eddy diffusion closure for the tracer flux,
\beq
\label{oc_diff}
\la v \vth \raxt = - \kappaoc G\com
\eeq
to obtain an explicit expression for the eddy diffusivity
\beq
\label{koc}
\kappaoc(y) = \frac{\la |\nabla \vth|^2 \raxt}{G^2} \kappa\per
\eeq
Note that the Osborn-Cox eddy diffusivity is simply an amplification of the molecular diffusivity, with the amplification
factor
\beq
A_{oc} = \frac{\la |\nabla \vth|^2 \raxt}{G^2}\per
\eeq
The amplification factor can be thought as a ratio of two length scales. In particular the perturbation of tracer scale as
$\vth \sim l_{mix} G$, where $l_{mix}$ is a mixing-length scale. Gradients of $\vth$ occur on relatively small scales extending
down to the Batchelor scale,
\beq
l_b = \left(\frac{\kappa}{S}\right)^{1/2}\com
\eeq
where $S$ is a characteristic scale of the rate of strain of the eddy field. Hence,
\beq
\label{Aoc_scaling}
A_{oc} \sim \frac{l_{mix}^2}{l_{b}^2} \Longrightarrow \kappaoc \sim l_{mix}^2 S\per
\eeq
It is pleasing that the eddy diffusivity scaling \eqref{Aoc_scaling} is independent of the molecular diffusivity $\kappa$.

\subsubsection{The Nakamura method}

A different approach to estimating the eddy diffusivity is the method of Nakamura ). In particular, Nakamura showed that averaging the advection-diffusion equation \eqref{ad} along tracer contours eliminates the advective eddy transport. The transformed equation resemble a diffusion equation in area coordinate with diffusivity (see appendix A for a derivation of the method):
\beq
\label{kN}
K_{n}(\Th, t) = L_{eq}^2 \kappa\com
\eeq
where $L_{eq}$ is the equivalent length of the contour. $K_N$ is an instantaneous measure of mixing as a function of each contour $\Th$; $K_n$it has units of (length)$^4$ (time$^{-1}$). The Nakamura eddy diffusivity is then defined as
\beq
\kappaN(\Th) = \la K_n\ra_t/L_{min}^2\com
\eeq
where $L_{min}$ is the minimum length of the contour ($L_x$ in this case). One generally maps the Nakamura diffusivity from 
 contour $\Th$ to physical space $\Th = \Th(y)$ either using the structure of the background tracer concentration ($G y$) or by constructing a simple one-to-one map based on the distribution of the stirred tracer field.

\subsubsection{RW model simulations}
We now diagnose eddy diffusivities using both Osborn-Cox and Nakamura methods in reference simulations of the Renovated Waves (RW) model.  The RW model implemented with background constant tracer concentration $G$ is a plain-vanilla example of ``Statistically Homogeneous Isotropic Transport'' setup where the eddy diffusivity is given by Einstein's formula
\beq
\label{einstein_eddy_diffusivity}
\kappa_{ein} = \frac{u_{rms}^2 \tau}{4}\per
\eeq 
Another important property of this model is that the scale separation between the mean tracer concentration and perturbations is infinite, and therefore the eddy diffusion closure is justified.






% large scale source
\subsection{Advection-diffusion with a simple large-scale source}

We employ a simple large-scale source
\beq
S(y) = \cos \left(\frac{2 \pi}{L_y}y\right)\per
\eeq
Because the source is only a function of $y$, half of the source is performed after the $x-$advection
substep
\beq
\label{source_x}
\vth^{n+1/2} = \vth^{n+1/2} + \frac{\dt}{2} S(y)\per
\eeq
The other half of the source could be applied in the same fashion, after the $y-$advection
substep
\beq
\label{source_y}
\vth^{n+1} = \vth^{n+1} + \frac{\dt}{2} S(y)\per
\eeq
In principle \eqref{source_y} is a brutal way to apply the source since source term is not invariant in $y$.
To apply the source more accurately, we note that in the ``$y$-advection''+``half-source'' substeps, we are
solving
\beq
\vth_t + v(x) \vth_y = \cos \left(\frac{2 \pi}{L_y}y\right)\com
\eeq
which can be easily integrated along the characteristics $y = y_0 + v \dt/2$, to give
\beq
\label{adv_source_y}
\vth(x,y,t+\dt) = \vth(x,y,\dt) + \frac{\sin\left[ k_1 (y_0 + v \dt/2 )\right] - \sin k_1 y_0}{k_1 v}\per
\eeq
where $k_1 \defn \frac{2\pi}{L_y}$. We anticipate loss of accuracy for in regions where $v\approx 0$. To
avoid this inaccuracies, we identify these points numerically, and use the exact value in limit $\dt \to 0$.
This limit can be calculated using the L'Hospital rule, simply expanding about $v=0$, to obtain
\beq
\frac{\sin\left[ k_1 (y_0 + v \dt/2 )\right] - \sin k_1 y_0}{k_1 v} \to \frac{\dt}{2}\cos k_1 y_0 \qquad \text{as}
\qquad v \to 0\per
\eeq

In summary, the algorithm for this forced advection-diffusion problem on a lattice, every iteration is
composed by the following substeps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $x-$advection
    \item half source
    \item $y-$advection + half source
    \item diffusion
\end{enumerate}
Of course, one could break the diffusion step in two substeps, to be performed after the advection.
In practice, there is no significant difference, and we opt to use the single step difusion above
for computational efficiency. 




\subsection{Did Einstein get it right?}
For this simple model the $x-$averaged equation is
\beq
\label{xave_cos}
\bvth_t   = \cos k_1 y + D \p_y^2 \bvth\com
\eeq
In statistical steady state, averaging either in time or over ensembles, we obtain
\beq
D \p_y^2\langle \bvth\rangle = -\cos k_1 y\com
\eeq
$\langle\rangle$ denotes either time or ensemble average. Thus,
\beq
\langle \bvth \rangle = \frac{\cos k_1 y}{D k_1^2}\per
\eeq
For this simple model, we can calculate the effective diffusivity $D$ exactly (Einstein, 1905)
\beq
\label{einstein_diff}
D = \frac{\langle (\dx)^2 \rangle}{2 \tau}\com
\eeq
where $\langle (\dx)^2 \rangle$ is the mean-square displacement. Intrinsic in the derivation of
\eqref{einstein_diff} is the scale separation between the flow that performs the  advection
and the large-scale gradient. In the generalized RW model, we have
\beq
\langle (\dx)^2 \rangle = \langle u_n^2 \tau^2\rangle = \frac{u_{rms}^2 (\dt)^2}{4}\com
\eeq
and therefore
\beq
\label{Dein}
D = \frac{u_{rms}^2 \tau}{4}\per
\eeq

Figure \ref{p35} shows a comparison between theory, using Einstein's effective difusivity
\eqref{Dein}, and numerical calculation on the lattice model. With scale separation, there
is spectacular agreement between theory and numerics (see Figure \ref{p35} left). Even
the $x-$averaged concentration of snapshots is reasonably consistent with the theoretical prediction.
Without scale separation, there is still reasonable consistency, but the spread about the time-mean
is much larger.

            and the thin gray lines represent snapshots. The blue line is the theoretical prediction.}

            trace concentration has been removed before calculating the spectrum.}

            As expected, the  $x-$averaged tracer concentration is nearly independent unless the molecular
            diffusivity is too large.}
\end{figure}

\section{Approximate Methods for Effective Diffusivity}
These methods have the form

\beq
K = A^2 \kappa\com
\eeq
where $K$ is an approximation to the true diffusivity $D$, $\kappa$ is the molecular diffusivity, and $A^2$ is an amplification factor.

\subsection{A variance budget approach: Osborn-Cox}
Osborn-Cox employs a tracer variance budget approach to estimate the effective diffusivity. Multiplying \eqref{pad} and $x-$averaging, we obtain
\beq
\label{th2_ko}
\frac{\dd}{\dd t} \frac{\overline{\vth'^2}}{2} +  \p_y \left(\overline{v' \frac{\vth'^2}{2}}\right) + 
\overline{v' \vth'} \p_y \bvth = -\kappa \overline{ |\nabla \vth'|^2} + \kappa \p_y^2 \overline{\frac{\vth'^2}{2}}\per
\eeq
With the eddy diffusivity hypothesis, i.e.,
\beq
\label{eddy_diff_Koc}
\overline{v' \vth'} = - K_{oc} \p_y \bvth\com
\eeq
we have, in statistical steady state,
\beq
\label{th2_ko_2}
+ \p_y \left(\overline{v' \frac{\vth'^2}{2}}\right) - 
K_{oc} (\p_y \bvth)^2 =  - \kappa \overline{|\nabla \vth'|^2} + \kappa \p_y^2 \overline{\frac{\vth'^2}{2}}\per
\eeq

The Osborn-Cox approach ignores the first term on the left and the last term on the right of \eqref{th2_ko_2}, so that the
Osborn-Cox eddy diffusivity is
\beq
\label{koc}
K_{oc} = \frac{\overline{ |\nabla \vth'|^2}}{\bar{\vth}_y^2}\kappa\per
\eeq
\subsection{Monitoring the lengthening of tracer contours: Nakamura}

See appendix A for a derivation.

\beq
\label{kN}
K_{N} = \frac{L^2}{L_{min}^2}\kappa\per
\eeq

\section{Diffusion suppression by a mean flow}
To study the suppression of eddy diffusivity by a mean flow, we simply add a constant zonal velocity to 
\eqref{un} and \eqref{vn}. The $x-$advection on the lattice is only slightly changed:

\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= U + u(y)\com  [0,\tau/2] :  x= x_0 + [U + u(y)]\frac{\tau}{2}\per \nonumber \\
\dot{y} &= 0\com   [0,\tau/2]  :             y = y_0\per
\end{align}
The $y$-advection is
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= U + \com  [\tau/2,\tau] :  x= x_0 + U\tau/2\per \nonumber \\
\dot{y} &= v(x)\com  [\tau/2,\tau]  :            \dot{y} =  v(x_0  + U \tau/2)\per
\end{align}
Hence
\beq
y = y_0 + C \sum_{j=j_{min}}^{j_{max}} \left(\frac{j}{j_{min}}\right)^{-p/2}\!\!\! \frac{1}{U k} \left[\sin\left(k (x + U \tau) j + \psi_j\right)-\sin\left(k (x + U \tau/2) j + \psi_j \right)\right]\com
\eeq
The mean square displacement is
\beq
\la  (\Delta y )^2\ra =  C^2 \sum_k \left( \frac{j}{j_{min}} \right)^{-p} \left[\frac{1- \cos\left(U k \tau/2\right)}{(Uk)^2}\right]\per
\eeq
Note that in the limit of small mean velocity, $Uk \tau/2 \to 0$, we obtain the mean-square displacement for the non-mean-flow case:
\beq
\la  (\Delta y )^2\ra = u_{rms}^2 \frac{\tau^2}{4}\per
\eeq

\section{Derivation of Nakamura's Eddy Diffusivity}

The Nakamura effective diffusivity arises when transforming the diffusion equation into a area/contour coordinate system, i.e. A = $A(\Th,t)$, where $A$ is the area bounded by the contour $\Th$ at time $t$. Because the area bounded by a contour $\Th$ is a well-defined graph, i.e. $\Th = \Th(A,t)$ (see figure \ref{SnapAndCDF}), we have
\beq
\Th = \vth[A(\Th,t),t]\com
\eeq
so that
\beq
\label{useful_relations}
\frac{\p \vth}{\p A}A_t + \vth_t = 0 \qquad \text{and }\qquad  \frac{\p \vth}{\p A} \frac{\p A}{\p \Th} = 1\per

The integral of the scalar function $f$ over the surface inside curves $\gamma(\Th+\dd \Th/2)$ and $\gamma(\Th-\dd \Th/2)$ (see figure \ref{SchematicsCoord}) is

\newcommand{\A}{\p A}

\beq
\label{area_int}
\delta I_\Th(f) = \iint_{\A^+}\!\! f \, \dd x \dd y  - \iint_{\A^-}\!\! f \, \dd x \dd y  =   \delta \vth
            \oint_{\gamma} f \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}\per
\eeq
where $\A^+ = \A(\Th+\delta \Th/2)$ and $\A^-= \A(\Th-\delta \Th/2)$.
Thus in the limit $\delta \Th \to 0$,
\beq
\frac{\p }{\p \Th}I_\Th(f) =\frac{\p}{\p \Th}  \iint_{\A}\!\! f \, \dd x \dd y   = \oint_{\gamma} f \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}\per
\eeq
In particular, the specific case $f=1$ gives:
\beq
\label{dAdth}
\frac{\p }{\p \Th}A =  \oint_{\gamma}  \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}\com
\eeq
where the total area of the surface bounded by $\Th$ is $A = I_\Th(1)$. The thickness average of $f$ along the $\gamma(\Th)$ is defined by
\beq
\label{defn_ave}
\langle f\rangle_\Th \defn  \frac{\oint_{\gamma} f \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}}{\oint_{\gamma} \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}} = \frac{\p }{\p A}I_\Th(f)\per
\eeq

With the results above, we are ready to transform the advection-diffusion equation onto a coordinate system defined by the countour $\Th$. First, we note that the rate of change of the  material surface A is given by
\beq
A_t =  \oint_\gamma \vu_c \cdot \hat{\vn} \, \dd l\com
\eeq
where the velocity of the contour, locally normal to the contour, is defined by
\beq
\vu_c = - \theta_t \frac{\nabla \theta}{|\nabla \theta|^2} = -  \frac{\theta_t}{|\nabla \theta|}\hat{\vn}\per
\eeq
Thus, using the advection-diffusion equation \eqref{ad}, we obtain
\begin{align}
\frac{\p A}{\p t} =  - \oint_\gamma \theta_t \, \frac{\dd l}{{|\nabla \theta|}} &= 
                       \oint_\gamma \, \nabla \cdot (\vu \vth) \frac{\dd l}{{|\nabla \theta|}} 
                      - \kappa \oint_\gamma \lap \vth   \frac{\dd l}{{|\nabla \theta|}} 
                      - \oint_\gamma S  \frac{\dd l}{{|\nabla \theta|}}\nonumber \\
                     & =  \frac{\p}{\p \Th}\underbrace{\iint \nabla \cdot (\vu \vth) \dd A}_{=0}
                        -  \kappa  \frac{\p}{\p \Th}\underbrace{\iint \lap \vth \dd A}_{=\oint |\nabla\vth|^2\frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}}
                        -  \frac{\p}{\p \Th}\iint S  \dd A  \per
\end{align}
Now using \eqref{useful_relations} we obtain
\begin{align}
\frac{\p \vth}{\p t} &= \kappa \frac{\p}{\p A} \iint \lap \vth \dd A + \frac{\p }{\p A} \iint S  \dd A \nonumber\\
                     &= \frac{\p}{\p A}\left(K_n(A,t) \frac{\p \vth}{\p A}\right) + \langle S \rangle_\Th\com
\end{align}
where the effective diffusivity  is
\beq
\label{KeDefn}
K_n (A, t) =  \frac{ \kappa \oint_\gamma |\nabla\vth| \dd l }{\p \vth/\p A} 
        =  \kappa  \underbrace{\frac{\p A}{\p \Th}}_{\oint_\gamma \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|}} \oint_\gamma |\nabla\vth| \dd l 
        = \frac{\p A}{\p \Th}\frac{\p }{\p A} \iint_{\p A}  \kappa  |\nabla\vth|^2 \dd x \dd y = 
        \frac{\langle \kappa  |\nabla\vth|^2 \rangle_\Th}{ (\p \vth/\p A)^2} \per
\eeq
Note that the effective diffusivity has units of (length)$^4$$\times$(time)$^{-1}$. The Nakamura eddy diffusivity is defined by
\beq
\label{knak}
\kappaN(\Th,t) = \frac{K_e}{L_{min}^2} = \frac{L_{eq}^2}{L_{min}^2}\kappa\com
\eeq
where the equivalent length is
\beq
\label{Leq}
L_{eq}^2 \defn \oint_\gamma \frac{\dd l}{|\nabla \vth|} \oint_\gamma |\nabla \vth| \dd l \com
\eeq
and $L_{min}$ is the minimum length of the contour (without distortion by eddies). In simple domain such as periodic channel,
 $L_{min}$ is unambiguously defined as the length of the channel. In more complicated realistic geometry and source functions, the definition of $L_{min}$ may not be straightforward. In practice, one can estimate $L_{min}$ by calculating $L_{eq}$ in simulations with large Peclet number ($\kappaN \to \kappa$). 
A lower bound on \eqref{Leq} is obtained using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality\footnote{$\oint_\gamma f^2 \dd l \oint_\gamma g^2 \dd l \ge \left(\oint_\gamma f\,g \,\dd l\right)^2.$}:
\beq
L_{eq}^2 \ge L^2 = \Big(\oint_\gamma \dd l \Big)^2\per
\eeq
While the equivalent length notation above provides a useful interpretation, in practice  one does not compute
line integrals. Instead, the third equality in \eqref{KeDefn} suggests a straightforward numerical approximation
\beq
K_e(\Th,t) \approx \frac{\delta I_\Th(1)}{(\delta \Th)^2} \delta I_\Th(\kappa |\nabla \vth|^2) \com 
\eeq
where $\delta I_\theta(f)$ is the approximate area integral of $f$ within the contours $\Th + \dd \Th/2$ and $\Th - \dd \Th/2$ (see figure 5). These approximate integrals are computed simply by counting pixels:
\beq
\delta I_\Th(f) = \sum_j f \dd x \dd y\com \qquad \Th - \dd \Th/2 \leq \vth \leq \Th + \dd \Th/2 \com
\eeq
 where the summation on $j$ represents the pixels within the contour. In practice the diagnostic is not very sensitive to the 
 contour spacing $\dd \Th$.
 
 Finally note that the Nakamura diffusivity is a function of the the contour $\Th$ (or equivalently of the area bounded by the contour). With simple geometry of initial conditions and source function, $\kappa_N(\Th,t)$  can be mapped to physical space, e.g. as direction of the tracer gradient or the equivalent latitude.
